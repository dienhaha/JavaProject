14. Write a WeightConverter class. An instance of this class is created by
    passing the gravity of an object relative to the Earth’s gravity (see
    Exercise 16 on page 144). For example, the Moon’s gravity is
    approximately 0.167 of the Earth’s gravity, so we create a
    WeightConverter instance for the Moon as
    WeightConverter moonWeight;
    moonWeight = new WeightConverter( 0.167 );
    To compute how much you weigh on the Moon, you pass your weight on
    Earth to the convert method as
    yourMoonWeight = moonWeight.convert( 160 );
    Use this class and redo Exercise 16 on page 144.
