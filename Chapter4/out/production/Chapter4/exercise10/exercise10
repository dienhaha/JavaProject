10. Modify the Bicycle class so instead of assigning the name of an owner
(Student), you can assign the owner object itself. Model this new Bicycle
class after the LibraryCard class.

class Bicycle {
    // Data Member
    private String ownerName;

    //Constructor: Initializes the data member
    public Bicycle( ) {
    ownerName = "Unknown";
    }

    //Returns the name of this bicycle's owner
    public String getOwnerName( ) {
    return ownerName;
    }

    //Assigns the name of this bicycle's owner
    public void setOwnerName(String name) {
    ownerName = name;
    }
}

class LibraryCard {
    // Data Members
    //student owner of this card
    private Student owner;
    //number of books borrowed
    private int borrowCnt;
    //Constructor
    public LibraryCard(){
    owner = null;
    borrowCnt = 0;
    }
    //numOfBooks are checked out
    public void checkOut(int numOfBooks) {
    borrowCnt = borrowCnt + numOfBooks;
    }
    //Returns the number of books borrowed
    public int getNumberOfBooks(){
    return borrowCnt;
    }
    //Returns the name of the owner of this card
    public String getOwnerName(){
    return owner.getName( );
    }
    //Sets owner of this card to student
    public void setOwner(Student student) {
    owner = student;
    }
    //Returns the string representation of this card
    public String toString(){
    return  "Owner Name:    " + owner.getName( ) + "\n" +
            " Email:        " + owner.getEmail( ) + "\n" +
            "Books Borrowed: " + borrowCnt;
    }
}
