6. Write a program that computes the total ticket sales of a concert. There are
three types of seating's: A, B, and C. The program accepts the number of
tickets sold and the price of a ticket for each of the three types of seats. The
total sales are computed as follows:
        totalSales = numberOfA_Seats * pricePerA_Seat +
                     numberOfB_Seats * pricePerB_Seat +
                     numberOfC_Seats * pricePerC_Seat;
